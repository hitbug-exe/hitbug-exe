About me: Anon Hobbyist hacker[!=cracker] building software for fun.

<Ignore>

"""I am a deep generalist who is annoyingly optimistic. I build boring businesses [Waste Management, Real Estate, Consultancy] and interesting software [Recommendation systems, Programming Languages, Privacy-Preserving P2P networks]. I advocate Free and Open-Source Software and Open Science. I believe in individual sovereignty and free and unbiased information."""

</Ignore>

Languages: I am mostly language/stack agnostic. Love everything close to the metal AND python lol.
